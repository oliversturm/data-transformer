# data-transformer.js

**data-transformer.js** supplies assorted helper functions to facilitate transformations of data structures. It utilizes iterables for lazy evaluation behavior of data sequences. 

## Installation

## Usage

## Examples

**Note that many the examples below show the use of the `Array.from` helper to convert resulting iterables to arrays. To preserve lazy evaluation behavior of the sequences, you should only convert iterables to arrays if necessary, and generally this should be done as late as possible.**


### map

**map** applies a function sequentially to elements of a source iterable and yields the result of each call.

Call map like this:

```
Array.from(map(x => x * 2, [1, 2]))

[2, 4]
```

You can obtain the index of the element in the source sequence:

```
Array.from(map((x, index) => x * i, [1, 2]))

[0, 2]
```

Since map works with iterables, your input data doesn't have to be an array:

```
Array.from(map(x => x * x, (function*() => yield 3)()))

[9]
```

Any iterable data type is supported:

```
Array.from(map(x=> x + x, "hello"))

["hh", "ee", "ll", "ll", "oo"]
```

### fold

**fold** aggregates values in a sequence using a reducer function and a starting value. It assumes an iterable as a source sequence, the behavior is unsurprising.

```
fold((r, v) => r + v, 0, [1, 2, 3])

6
```

Indices can be obtained using a third parameter on the reducer:

```
fold((r, v, i) => r + v * i, 0, [1, 2, 3])

8
```

### iterableOfIterablesToObjects

Assuming this source array of arrays:

```
const source = [[1, 2], ["one", "two"]];
```

You can pass in the names for fields expected in the result objects:

```
Array.from(iterableOfIterablesToObjects(source, ["one", "two"]))

[ { one: 1, two: 2 }, { one: "one", two: "two" } ]
```

If you don't pass in enough field names, they are generated automatically:

```
Array.from(iterableOfIterablesToObjects(source))

[ { field0: 1, field1: 2 }, { field0: "one", field1: "two" } ]

Array.from(iterableOfIterablesToObjects(source, ["one"]))

[ { one: 1, field1: 2 }, { one: "one", field1: "two" } ]
```

To use a different field prefix instead of the standard "field", pass it as a third parameter:

```
Array.from(iterableOfIterablesToObjects(source, [], "xxx"))

[ { xxx0: 1, xxx1: 2 }, { xxx0: "one", xxx1: "two" } ]
```

Alternatively, pass a function that generates a field prefix, or generates a full field name and skips automatic field numbering:

```
Array.from(iterableOfIterablesToObjects(source, [], () => "xxx"))

[ { xxx0: 1, xxx1: 2 }, { xxx0: "one", xxx1: "two" } ]

Array.from(iterableOfIterablesToObjects(source, [], (a, ai, v, vi) => 
    ({ prefix: "i" + ai + "-f" + (vi + 1), skipNumbering: true })))
	
[ { "i0-f1": 1, "i0-f2": 2 }, { "i1-f1": "one", "i1-f2": "two" } ]
```

Since input values don't have to be arrays, you can also use any other iterable data type:

```
function* innerIterable(x) {
    yield x * 3;
    yield x * 5;
}

function* outerIterable() {
    yield innerIterable(3);
    yield innerIterable(5);
}
    
Array.from(iterableOfIterablesToObjects(outerIterable()))

[ { field0: 9, field1: 15 }, { field0: 15, field1: 25 } ]
```



### flattenOneToN

Assuming a structure of completely fictitious data, a simple call to **flattenOneToN** returns a flat data structure:

```
const data = [
  { country: "UK",
    cities: [
      { city: "London", population: 10000000 },
      { city: "Edinburgh", population: 800000 } ] },
  { country: "USA",
    cities: [
      { city: "New York", population: 12000000 }] } 
]

Array.from(flattenOneToN(data))

[
  { country: "UK", city: "London", population: 10000000 },
  { country: "UK", city: "Edinburgh", population: 800000 },
  { country: "USA", city: "New York", population: 12000000 }
]
```

If there are several n-fields in the source objects, the resulting sequence contains permutations:

```
Array.from(flattenOneToN([
  { country: "UK",
    cities: [
      { city: "London", population: 10000000 },
      { city: "Edinburgh", population: 800000 } ],
    counties: [
      { county: "Kent" },
      { county: "Buckinghamshire" },
      { county: "Warwickshire" },
      { county: "Yorkshire" } ]
  } 
]))
	
[
  { "city": "London", "country": "UK", "county": "Kent", "population": 10000000 },
  { "city": "London", "country": "UK", "county": "Buckinghamshire", "population": 10000000 },
  { "city": "London", "country": "UK", "county": "Warwickshire", "population": 10000000 },
  { "city": "London", "country": "UK", "county": "Yorkshire", "population": 10000000 },
  { "city": "Edinburgh", "country": "UK", "county": "Kent", "population": 800000 },
  { "city": "Edinburgh", "country": "UK", "county": "Buckinghamshire", "population": 800000 },
  { "city": "Edinburgh", "country": "UK", "county": "Warwickshire", "population": 800000 },
  { "city": "Edinburgh", "country": "UK", "county": "Yorkshire", "population": 800000 }
]
```

Instead of relying on the automatic detection of n-fields, you can pass in their names explicitly. If there are fields that would automatically be recognized as n-fields but are excluded explicitly, they will become part of the result objects without flattening:

```
Array.from(flattenOneToN([
  { country: "UK",
    cities: [
      { city: "London", population: 10000000 },
      { city: "Edinburgh", population: 800000 } ],
    counties: [
      { county: "Kent" },
      { county: "Buckinghamshire" } ]
  } ],
["cities"]))

[
  { "city": "London", "country": "UK",  "population": 10000000, counties: [
    { county: "Kent" },
    { county: "Buckinghamshire" }
  ] },
  { "city": "Edinburgh", "country": "UK", "population": 800000, counties: [
    { county: "Kent" },
    { county: "Buckinghamshire" }
  ] }
]
```
